You can access the build folder of our application from our extension GitHub link. Once you have downloaded the build files, you can easily add them as a Chrome extension using the following steps:
Open Google Chrome and navigate to the "Extensions" page. You can access this by clicking on the three dots at the top-right corner of the browser window and selecting "More Tools" to "Extensions."
On the Extensions page, make sure that the "Developer mode" toggle switch at the top-right corner is turned on.
Click on the "Load unpacked" button at the top-left corner of the page. This will open a file browser window.
Navigate to the location where you have downloaded and extracted the build files. Select the folder containing the build files and click "Select Folder."
Chrome will now load the extension from the selected folder. You should see the extension's icon appear in the Chrome toolbar.
